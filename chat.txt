31/07/25, 1:14 am - Bee 🐝: When I was working at On Source, I lied at home and said I have a meeting and will stay at a colleague’s place, but I actually went for a night out. My friend told me to say that, and my family gave permission. I was doing 3 days in Thane, 3 in Andheri that time. After finishing work, we went to Virar for the nightout. Her boyfriend was also there. he drank too much, couldn’t even walk. I got scared because I had to leave for my village early morning. I even stopped picking up my family’s calls out of fear.
31/07/25, 1:16 am - Bee 🐝: So my family searched my boss’s number on Google and directly they called him they said Priyanka had a meeting and was going to stay at her colleague’s place, but she didn’t share the colleague’s number—that’s why we’re calling you. That’s how my lie got caught. I was actually in Thane that day, not at any colleague’s place etc
31/07/25, 1:18 am - ᴘʀɪɴᴄᴇ⚡: nyt out.. like wht for over nyt you've been out !??
31/07/25, 1:18 am - ᴘʀɪɴᴄᴇ⚡: nd who is her boyfriend ?
31/07/25, 1:19 am - Bee 🐝: Then in the morning, I took a train from Kurla and went home. I had no idea they had called my boss. When I reached, everyone started questioning me—where were you, who were you with, you didn’t come all night. Then I told them the truth. Now they don’t allow me to go anywhere or talk to anyone.
31/07/25, 1:21 am - Bee 🐝: I don’t know much, but he was bewda and drugs addicted

31/07/25, 1:28 am - ᴘʀɪɴᴄᴇ⚡: its really so hurting which you've done with ur family. u don't even know who they all r nd u were jus teen nd you've been out for 3nyts out also even when u knw that his bf addicted with drugs.

31/07/25, 1:34 am - Bee 🐝: Yeah, it was my mistake. later that friend came home and told everything, so things got a bit clear. Papa already knew her
31/07/25, 1:35 am - ᴘʀɪɴᴄᴇ⚡: k so wht even for one nyt it still.. so bad idea to do. u should've asked with ur family abt it if they doesn't listen u need to explain them in soft way nd u hav to make them sure that you'll be safe.
