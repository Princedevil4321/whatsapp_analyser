# whatsapp_analyser
An AI-powered WhatsApp chat analyzer that provides deep insights into conversation dynamics. This project uses Python, Streamlit, and a language model to process raw chat data, generate key user statistics, visualize activity patterns, and create a dynamic summary of communication and sentiment.

What the Analysis Shows
After you upload your chat.txt file, the app processes the data and generates a full report with the following insights:

User Statistics: A breakdown of who is the most active and who writes the most messages.

Response Analysis: A look at communication patterns, including average reply times and the longest "active streaks" for each person.

Activity Trends: Visuals that show when the conversation is most active, with a monthly bar chart and a heatmap of message frequency by day and hour.

Emoji and Word Usage: A report on the most frequently used emojis and a list of the most common words, excluding common "filler" words.

Sentiment Analysis: A machine-learning based assessment of the emotional tone, categorizing messages as positive, negative, or neutral.

AI-Powered Summary: A dynamic, conversational summary that interprets all the data to describe the overall relationship and communication style.

How to Use
Export your desired chat from WhatsApp as a .txt file (without media).

Upload the file to the web app.

The analysis will run automatically, and the full report will be displayed on the page.
